# Stock Watcher

This is a Polymer based application for tracking stock progress. You can add a list of stocks whose progress you want to track or you can set up your own portfolio to see the progress of your portfolio.

## License
The source code of this application is licensed under Apache License version 2.0, but note that the application uses Vaadin Charts, which requires a developer license. So, feel free to use the code, but if you want to build upon this, make sure you have your own Vaadin Charts license or then swap it to another graphing library. Deployment of the application doesn't require a license.

## Notes
This application is more of a proof-of-concept, where little attention has been paid for error handling or code quality in general. Use at your own risk :)
